It doesn't really mean anything. There isn't even a heart on it. So basically it's a card saying hi. Forget it." src="images/i-know-were-not-together.jpg"> </p>
				<p class="prodDescription">Although greeting cards are usually given on special occasions such as birthdays, Christmas or other holidays, they are also sent to convey thanks or express other feelings. This is one to express other feelings and nobody's really sure what those feelings are. Let me know if you figure out a better way to say it.</p>

				<p class="prodDescription">Although greeting cards are usually given on special occasions such as birthdays, Christmas or other holidays, they are also sent to convey thanks or express other feelings. This one is about people treating you--when you're going through a bad time--in a way intended to make you feel better but that actually makes you feel worse. It's a promise not to do that to your suffering friend. Because you're a good friend and you don't want to make it worse.</p>
